<h1>Gonerate</h1>
Gonerate is a simple cli application that allows you to generate base code to start your api in a simple way.

Gonerate helps you to start your project using the basic libraries from go, this will help you avoid any 
innecesary dependency with any other module out there.

- Rest API (done)

To use it you just need to run the code and the cli would help you to init the project.
Here's a simple example:

```~ go run main.go gonerate new rest books```

This will create a folder with your api ready to use, you just need to customize it for you and that should be!
